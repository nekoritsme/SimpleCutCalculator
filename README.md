# Use SimpleCutCalculator:
  - If you can't find fitness app that mathes you
  - If you think it must be simple, sometimes too simple
  - If you love controle everything within your program
  - If you have dart installed

# What`s the idea?
It's for people, whois doing their cuts (in fitness way). Store what you it, calculate when you eat. It's simple.



(It's doesnt calculate carbohydrates and fats - I personaly think it's doesn't matter, when you have a proper diet)


# Usage
```
dart init.dart
```
You **MUST** have a [] inside your database.json


- Calculate product: index, grams
- Add a new product: name, calories per 100g, protein per 100g
- Delete selected
- Clear entire database

(It's not a serious project, just for fun)
