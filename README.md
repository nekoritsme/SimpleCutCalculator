# Use SimpleCutCalculator:
  - If you can't find a fitness app that matches you
  - If you think it must be simple, sometimes too simple
  - If you love to control everything within your program
  - If you have dart installed

# What's the idea?
It's for people who are doing their cuts (in a fitness way). Store what you eat, calculate when you eat. It's simple.

# Features
- Calculate product: index, grams
- Add a new product: name, calories per 100g, protein per 100g
- Delete selected by index
- Clear the entire database

(It doesn't calculate carbohydrates and fats - I personally think it doesn't matter when you have a proper diet)


# Usage
```
dart init.dart
```
You **MUST** have a [] inside your database.json

(It's not a serious project, just for fun)
